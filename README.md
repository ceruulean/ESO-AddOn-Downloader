This PowerShell script is designed to parse ESOUI.com for your favorite AddOns and either list their details or download the latest version. For this, **ESO-Addon-Downloader** is using their unique AddOn ID to retreive the download page and parse the HTML for the required information.

## How to use

- Save the ps1 file to your computer.
- Right click and select "Open with PowerShell"
- Press the buttons displayed in the PowerShell console window.
- To add or remove AddOns, edit the array in line 3. You'll find AddOn IDs on ESOUI.com in the adress bar.
